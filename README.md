## Local hosting
Well, you could try, but be warned, Referee has quite some noughts and bolts that might make it complicated to selfhost. That being said, you're free to give it a go! Setup is fairly easy, just clone the repo and edit constants.py to contain your values. Other than this, don't expect support from the Dev team to get all the parts working as expected.

## Since it's hard to localhost, can I get a copy of Referee in my server?
No. Simply because Referee is built in a way that doesn't allow multi server compatability.
