# UHCBot
UHC Bot for all your UHC needs!

# Setup
To set up the bot clone the repo and change the `TOKEN` in `UHCBot.py` to the token your discord bot has. For creating a discord bot user go to [the discord developer site](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/create).
Then run `UHCBot.py` to start up the bot. Once the bot is started up you can run `!test` to test if everything is working.

Next, in discord, run `!setRole @<Role you want to be added on !join command>` **Note: this has to be a mention to this role** to set the role that will be added when a user types `!join`. Do the same for all the team roles using `!setTeam <Color> @<RoleToAdd>`. Once that's all done users can join using `!join` and join a team using `!team <Color>` where Color is the Color specified in the `!setTeam` command.
